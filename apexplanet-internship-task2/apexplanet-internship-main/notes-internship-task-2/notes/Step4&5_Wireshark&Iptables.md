STEP4- Packet Analysis with Wireshark

1- Capture HTTP, FTP, DNS Traffic –

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects network packets.

A. HTTP Traffic: Shows web requests/responses between client and server. Unencrypted HTTP traffic can reveal URLs, headers, and even form data.

Commands:
curl -I http://192.168.1.3
-I asks for the HTTP headers only (sends a HEAD request). You’ll see response headers like HTTP/1.1 200 OK, Content-Type, Server, Date, etc.
curl http://192.168.1.3 # You’ll see the HTML source(Ip of the victime's machine will be used)
curl -X POST -d "username=testuser&password=MyP@ss123" http://192.168.1.3
-X POST forces an HTTP POST request.-d "..." sets the POST body — here it simulates a form submission with two fields: username and password.
Wireshark Filters:
HTTP (all) : http
HTTP POST : http.request.method == "POST"
HTTP GET : http.request.method == "GET"
B. FTP Traffic: File Transfer Protocol sends files over the network. Classic FTP sends credentials (username/password) in plaintext, making it vulnerable to sniffing.

Commands:
ftp 192.168.1.3
Name: msfadmin
Password: msfadmin
C. DNS Traffic: Domain Name System translates domain names to IP addresses. Capturing DNS traffic lets you see which websites a host is querying. In Wireshark- dns

Command: dig @192.168.1.3example.test A OR
Capturing these allows you to understand what data flows on a network, which is fundamental in cybersecurity monitoring and analysis.

2- Filter Credentials from FTP-

FTP sends authentication details in clear text:
Username: USER command
Password: PASS command
By filtering in Wireshark (ftp.request.command == "USER" or "PASS") OR ftp.request.command == "USER" || ftp.request.command == "PASS", you can observe credentials in plaintext.
Purpose:
Demonstrates why unencrypted protocols are insecure.
Highlights importance of using secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS.
3- Analyze SYN Flood Attack-

A SYN flood is a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that overwhelms a target system by exploiting the - TCP handshake:
Attacker sends SYN (connection request) packets rapidly to the server.
Server responds with SYN-ACK (acknowledgement).
Attacker never sends final ACK, leaving half-open connections.
Server resources get exhausted, denying service to legitimate users.
Using hping3:
Command: sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 192.168.1.3(Ip address of victim's system)
-S → sets the SYN flag
-p 80 → targets port 80 (HTTP)
--flood → sends packets as fast as possible
Wireshark Filter: tcp.flags.syn==1 && tcp.flags.ack==0
Captures incoming SYN packets without corresponding ACKs.
Shows the high volume of SYN packets during the attack.
Purpose:
Demonstrates network attacks in a controlled lab.
Helps understand how DoS attacks work and the importance of firewall/IDS protections.
STEP 5- Firewall Basics

1.Create simple iptables rules (allow/deny specific ports).

Firewall controls network traffic to/from your system.
Iptables is the default firewall utility in Linux that works at the kernel level.
In real networks, firewalls control which ports/services are accessible.
You need to know how to allow/deny traffic using iptables (Linux firewall).
Rules can:
ACCEPT → allow traffic
DROP/REJECT → block traffic
Rules are applied on different chains:
INPUT → incoming traffic
OUTPUT → outgoing traffic
FORWARD → traffic passing through the machine
a) Allow a specific port
For example, allow SSH (22) only:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
b) Deny a specific port
For example, block HTTP (80):
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
c) Deny all other incoming traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
d) List current rules
sudo iptables -L -v
Result:
Only SSH connections work; HTTP or other ports are blocked.
This is useful for restricting services exposed on your system.
Demonstrate blocking a port scan attempt
A port scan is when someone probes your system to see which ports are open.
Nmap is a common tool to do this.
Using iptables, you can block traffic to ports you don’t want scanned or limit access to certain IPs.
To demonstrate that HTTP (port 80) is blocked, you can use Nmap like this:
sudo nmap -p 80 192.168.1.3
-p 80 → scan only port 80 (the one you blocked)
192.168.1.3 → IP of your Metasploitable VM
Result: Nmap will show port 80 filtered/closed, demonstrating your firewall rule is working.
By creating rules, you can control who can access which service, and prevent attackers from easily discovering open ports.
This is a basic but important part of network hardening in cybersecurity.
