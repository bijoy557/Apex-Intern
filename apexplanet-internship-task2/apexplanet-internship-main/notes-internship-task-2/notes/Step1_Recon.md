Step 1: Reconnaissance:

Objective -

Recon is the first phase of ethical hacking/network security testing.
Goal: Gather as much information about the target system as possible without causing disruption.
Helps you plan your next steps (scanning and vulnerability assessment) efficiently.
There are two main types of recon:
Passive Recon: Collect information without directly interacting with the target.
Active Recon: Collect information by interacting lightly with the target (ping, banners).
Step 1A: Passive Recon

Why passive recon first?
It’s safe and undetectable.No direct interaction with the target.
You can gather data from publicly available sources (like Google or WHOIS).
Gives an overview before actually probing the network.
These are the tools/methods included in passive recon:
Whois – Domain ownership and IP info.
Nslookup – DNS records (A, MX, NS).
Dig – Detailed DNS info (optional but useful).
Google Dorking – Search for publicly exposed sensitive info.
Shodan – Discover exposed devices and services online.
The tools/methods included in passive recon in detail:
Whois
Purpose: Find details about the domain/IP ownership.
What it tells you: Domain registrar, Creation and expiry dates, Contact info (emails, names), IP addresses allocated to the domain.
Why it’s useful:Helps you know who owns the domain, what IP ranges are assigned, and may hint at the organization’s infrastructure.
Nslookup
Purpose: Check DNS records for the domain.
What it tells you: IP addresses (A records), Mail servers (MX records), Name servers (NS records)
Why it’s useful: Understanding DNS mapping helps in network mapping and identifying hosts.
Dig (optional but recommended)
Purpose: Provides detailed DNS info.
Why it’s useful: Gives additional info not always visible in Nslookup. Helpful for discovering subdomains or alternate IPs.
Google Dorking
Purpose: Search for sensitive info indexed by Google.
Why it’s useful: You might find files, directories, or login portals exposed accidentally. Helps understand what the organization leaks publicly.
Shodan
Purpose: Scan the internet for devices/services exposed online.
What it tells you: Open ports and services, Device types, Vulnerable software versions
Why it’s useful: Helps you know if there are live services publicly accessible that could be exploited.
Step 1B: Active Recon

Why active recon after passive?
Passive gives general info.
Active helps validate what’s alive and running on the network.
It’s light interaction; doesn’t harm the system.
These are the tools/methods included in active recon:
Ping Sweep – Identify which hosts in a subnet are alive.
Banner Grabbing (FTP) – Check service type and version on FTP port.
Banner Grabbing (SSH) – Check service type and version on SSH port.
The tools/methods included in active recon in detail:
Ping Sweep
Purpose: Identify which hosts in a subnet are alive.Ping command to chcek whether the host is running.
Why it’s useful: You don’t waste time scanning dead hosts. Helps you focus on real targets.
Banner Grabbing
Purpose:
Check what services and versions are running on open ports.
When you connect to a service (like FTP, SSH, HTTP), many servers announce their software name + version in a banner.
Attackers (or penetration testers) can use that banner info to:
Identify the exact software running.
Look up known vulnerabilities for that version.
Plan targeted attacks or exploits.
Example: vsFTPd 2.3.4 has a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523). Just from this banner, we know the system is vulnerable to a specific exploit.
Why it’s useful: Knowing service versions helps identify known vulnerabilities.
Examples:
FTP banner grab → shows version (e.g., 2.3.4)
SSH banner grab → shows service details-
