Setup OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials
Definition: OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) and Nessus Essentials are tools used for vulnerability scanning, which helps identify security weaknesses in networks, systems, and applications. OpenVAS is free and open-source; Nessus Essentials has a free version for learning/personal use.

Purpose: To automatically detect vulnerabilities such as unpatched software, misconfigurations, weak passwords, and potential attack vectors.

Steps for Setup (OpenVAS/GVM):

Install OpenVAS/GVM using your Linux package manager (on Kali: sudo apt install gvm).
Initialize the scanner and synchronize feeds (NVTs - Network Vulnerability Tests).
Start services (sudo gvm-start).
Access Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) via https://127.0.0.1:9392.
Create a user or use an existing user for login.
Scan Test VM (Metasploitable2)
Definition: A vulnerability scan is performed on a target system to find potential security weaknesses. Metasploitable2 is a deliberately vulnerable VM used as a practice target.
Procedure:

Log in to GSA.
Add a target:
Name: Metasploitable2
IP: 192.168.1.3 (host-only network)
Create a task:
Select the target.
Choose the scan configuration (Full and Fast scan recommended for practice).
Start the scan:
The scanner sends probes to the target and identifies vulnerabilities automatically.
Types of vulnerabilities it can detect:
Unpatched services (e.g., outdated Apache, vsftpd)
Weak or default credentials
Open ports and misconfigurations
Vulnerable web applications (like DVWA)
Analyze Vulnerability Reports (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
Definition: After scanning, the tool generates a Vulnerability Report, showing details of each detected issue.

Severity Levels:

Critical: Immediate risk; can lead to full system compromise. Must be fixed urgently.
High: Serious vulnerabilities; attackers can exploit but may require some conditions.
Medium: Moderate risk; may require user interaction or specific conditions.
Low: Minor risk; usually informational or requires unlikely conditions.
Report Contents:

Vulnerability name: e.g., vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor
Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
Description: What the vulnerability is and how it works.
Affected service: Port/service affected (e.g., FTP on port 21)
Solution/Mitigation: How to fix it (patch, configuration change, disable service)
Purpose of Analysis:

Helps prioritize remediation based on severity.
Prepares documentation for system hardening or security audits.
Summary:

OpenVAS/Nessus is used for automated vulnerability scanning.
Metasploitable2 is used as a practice target.
Reports classify vulnerabilities from Critical → Low, enabling prioritized mitigation. OpenVAS Deliverables
Vulnerability Report:

After scanningThe Metasploitable2 VM, OpenVAS/GVM generates a report showing all detected vulnerabilities.
The report includes:

Target IP (e.g., 192.168.1.3)
Vulnerability Name (e.g., vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor)
Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
Affected Services/Ports (e.g., FTP port 21, HTTP port 80)
Description (what the vulnerability is and how it works)
Solution/Mitigation (how to fix it)
Report Formats
OpenVAS allows exporting in PDF, HTML, or XML formats.This Report is in PDF format.
Why it’s required:

It shows that you successfully scanned the target VM and analyzed vulnerabilities.
Demonstrates your ability to identify and classify vulnerabilities (Critical → Low).
It’s proof of completion for Task 2 Step 3.
Essential skills for Blue Team/Red Team cybersecurity learning.
