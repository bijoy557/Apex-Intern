APEXPLANET INTERN CYBERSECURITY TASK 1 NOTES


CIA Triad

Confidentiality → Keep data secret (encryption, passwords).

Integrity → Data should not be changed without permission (hashing, checksums).

Availability → Data/services must be available when needed (uptime, backups).


Threat Types

Phishing → Fake messages to steal info.

Malware → Malicious software (virus, trojan, worm).

DDoS → Overloading a server to make it unavailable.

SQL Injection → Inserting malicious queries in databases.

Brute Force → Trying many passwords until success.

Ransomware → Locks/encrypts files, demands money.


Attack Vectors

Social Engineering → Tricking people (phishing, fake calls).

Wireless Attacks → Hacking Wi-Fi (evil twin, WPA cracking).

Insider Threats → Employees misusing access.



2. Lab Environment Setup

VirtualBox / VMware → Tools to create virtual machines.

Kali Linux → Attacker machine (used for hacking tools).

Metasploitable2 / DVWA → Target machines (intentionally vulnerable).

Private Lab Network → Use Host-Only Adapter so hacking stays inside lab.



3. Networking Basics

OSI Model (7 Layers)

1. Physical (cables, signals)


2. Data Link (MAC, switches)


3. Network (IP, routers)


4. Transport (TCP/UDP)


5. Session (manages sessions)


6. Presentation (encryption, compression)


7. Application (HTTP, FTP, DNS)



TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

Application → HTTP, FTP, DNS

Transport → TCP/UDP

Internet → IP addressing

Network Access → Ethernet, Wi-Fi


DNS → Converts domain name → IP address.

HTTP/HTTPS → Web communication (HTTPS is secure with SSL/TLS).

IP Addressing → Unique ID of devices (IPv4 / IPv6).

Subnetting → Dividing network into smaller parts.

NAT (Network Address Translation) → Converts private IP to public IP for internet.



4. Cryptography Basics

Symmetric Encryption → Same key for encrypt/decrypt (AES, DES).

Asymmetric Encryption → Public & private key pair (RSA).

Hashing → One-way encryption (MD5, SHA256).

Digital Certificates & SSL/TLS → Used in HTTPS for secure communication.

OpenSSL → Tool for encrypting/decrypting messages.




5. Tool Familiarization

Wireshark → Capture & analyze network packets.

Nmap → Network scanning (find open ports, services).

Burp Suite → Web application testing (intercept requests).

Netcat → Network debugging, create connections, send/receive data.
